# brainTumor_detection
A deep learning–based system for detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model automatically extracts visual features from MRI scans to classify tumor and non-tumor cases with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in medical image analysis to assist in faster and more consistent diagnosis.
